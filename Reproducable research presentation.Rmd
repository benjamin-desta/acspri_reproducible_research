## What is reproducible research and replication

- Replication is the process in which the whole project from data collection through to analysis has been replicated.

- Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and general scientific claims, are published with their data and software code.

## Why reproducible research is important
- Replication is not feesible for all research projects, therefore it's vital that the analysis is reproducible as this is the only thing a reviewer can gaurantee about these studies.

- Reproducibility is important because it gives readers and reviewers confidence in understanding exactly what was done in the study.

## The reproducibility crisis in the social sciences
-  A methodological crisis where many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to replicate or reproduce.

- Other fields struggle with reproducibility. However social sciences face a distinct challenge, measuring human behavior/sentiment is less precise than measuring blood pressure for example.

- The Center for Open Science began The Reproducibility Project in November 2011, a project where 270 contributing authors set out to repeat 100 published psychological studies. Only ~36% of the studies were replicatable.

## What tools can I use to produce reproducable research?

- Rmarkdown

- Jupyter notebook 

- Git/Github

## Rmarkdown report example

- Here's one I prepared earlier...

## Conclusion

- Replication is still best method for research validation, reproducible research is the middle ground to replication.
- Utilities such as Rmarkdown/Jupyter notebook and platforms like github simplify generating reproducible research.
